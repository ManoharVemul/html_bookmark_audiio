    <h4 id="c1"> Born</h4>
           
            <p>	Siddhartha Gautama
                563 BCE or 480 BCE
                Lumbini, Shakya Republic (according to Buddhist tradition)[b]</p>
        
        <h4 id="c2"> Earli life</h4>
               
            Early life of Gautama Buddha
                He was born into a noble family of the Shakya Clan residing in the Himalayan foothills. The head of the Shakya clan, Suddhodana, was his father, while his mother Maya was a Koliyan princess. It is said that the court astrologers predicted that he would become a great sage or a Buddha.</p>
      <h4 id="c3"> Monkhood</h4>
            <p>The Four Noble Truths, or the truths of the Noble Ones,[70] taught in Buddhism are:
    
                Dukkha ("not being at ease", "suffering") is an innate characteristic of the perpetual cycle (samsara, lit. 'wandering') of grasping at things, ideas and habits
                Samudaya (origin, arising, combination; "cause"): dukkha is caused by taṇhā ("craving", "desire" or "attachment", literally "thirst")
                Nirodha (cessation, ending, confinement): dukkha can be ended or contained by the confinement or letting go of taṇhā
                Marga (path): the path leading to the confinement of taṇhā and dukkha, classically the Noble Eightfold Path but sometimes other paths to liberation
                </p>
        <h4 id="c4">as a histarical person</h4>
            <p>Scholars are hesitant to make claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most of them accept that the Buddha lived, taught, and founded a monastic order during the Mahajanapada, and during the reign of Bimbisara (his friend, protector, and ruler of the Magadha empire); and died during the early years of the reign of Ajatashatru (who was the successor of Bimbisara) thus making him a younger contemporary of Mahavira, the Jain tirthankara.[55][56]

    <h4 id="c5">Death</h4>
  
            <p>	c. 483 BCE or 400 BCE (aged 80)
                Kushinagar, Malla republic (according to Buddhist tradition) 	Cremated; ashes divided among followers</p>
       
       <h4 id="c6">Bhuddism</h4>
                
    
            <p>The religion based on the teachings of the Buddha is known as Buddhism. The Buddha was born with the name Siddhartha Gautama and lived sometime in the 6th to the 4th century bce. He became enlightened, meaning that he found a way to free himself from the cycle of desire and suffering. The Buddha taught his followers how to achieve this too.
    
    Buddhism began in India and spread to central and southeastern Asia, China, Korea, and Japan. Today some people in the Western world also follow Buddhism. In the mid-2010s, Buddhism was the fourth-largest religion in the world, with about 500 million followers</p>
